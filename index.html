    <p> <h2>What is database and dbms? Listout the advantages and disadvantages of dbms. </h2>
        <br>
        A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
         Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
         The data in a database is organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
         <br>
         <h2>Advantages of DBMS </h2> <br>
         Data Abstraction: hides the complexities of data storage from users. <br>
Efficient data handling: Manages large amounts of data efficiently. <br>
Concurrent access: supports simultaneous access by multiple users. <br>
Data Integrity and Security: Ensures that only authorized users can access and modify data. <br>
<h2>Disadvantages of DBMS: </h2><br>
Complexity: implementing a DBMS can be complex and time-consuming. <br>
Cost: Licensing, maintaining, and operating a DBMS can be expensive. <br>
Performance Overhead: The abstraction and additional features can sometimes lead to performance overhead. <br>

      <h2>Explain the different models of DBMS with advantages and disadvantages.</h2>
     Hierarchical Model <br>
Data is organized in a tree-like structure. Each child record has only one parent. Example: IBM's Information Management System (IMS). <br>
Advantages: Simple and easy to understand. Efficient for data with a clear hierarchy <br> 
disadvantages: Rigid structure; hard to reorganize or change relationships. Redundancy in data if multiple parents need the same child. <br>
Network Model <br>
Data is organized using a graph structure, allowing multiple parent-child relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS). <br>
Advantages: Faster data access using direct link. Supports many-to-many relationships. <br>
Disadvantages: Complex to design and maintain. Requires navigational knowledge to access data. <br>
Relational Model <br>
 Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL. <br>
 Advantages: Flexible and scalable; tables can be modified easily. Powerful query capabilities using SQL.
<br>
Disadvantages: Requires more processing power for relational operations. Performance may degrade with very large volumes of data. <br>
    </p>
<P><h2>Relational Database model</h2>
A relational database (RDB) is a way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns. An RDB has the ability to establish
 links or relationships between information by joining tables, which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationship between various data points.

    <h2>Data redundency</h2>
    Redundancy means having multiple copies of the same data in the database. This problem arises when a database is not normalized. 
    DBMS removes the data that are already present. It helps in normalizing the data and connecting data in diffrent tables so that the data that are present in the database
    aren't repeated and don't take much space.

    <h2>Who is Database Administrator (DBA)? What are the major responsibilities of DBA?</h2>
    A Database Administrator (DBA) is a technical expert responsible for managing, maintaining, and securing a database system. 
    The DBA ensures that the database is available, reliable, efficient, and secure, supporting the needs of the users and applications.
    <br>
    Major responsibilities are: <br>
    Database Installation and Configuration <br>
     Database Design and Implementation <br>
     Data Backup and Recovery <br>
     Performance Monitoring and Tuning <br>

        <h2>Different types of keys</h2>
        A primary key is a unique key, meaning it can uniquely identify each record in a table. <br>
        The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as a candidate key. <br>
        A foreign key is an attribute in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

        <h2>What is SQL? Explain its components and common functions. </h2>
        SQL is a standard language used to manage and manipulate data in a relational database. 
        It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data easily using commands. <br>
        Some sql componenets: <br>
        Databases: Databases are structured collections of data organized into tables, rows, and columns. 
        Databases serve as repositories for storing information efficiently and provide a way to manage and access data. <br>
        Tables: Tables are the fundamental building blocks of a database, consisting of rows and columns . 
        Tables ensure data integrity and consistency by defining the structure and relationships of the stored information. <br>
        Queries: Queries are SQL commands used to interact with databases. 
        They enable users to retrieve, update, insert, or delete data from tables, allowing for efficient data manipulation and retrieval. <br>
        Some functions in sql are min, max, floor ceiling, etc.

<h1>C Programming - Functions</h1>

    <h2>Define Function</h2>
    <p>
        A function in C is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help in breaking a large program into smaller, manageable parts, making the code more modular and reusable.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax of Functions</h2>
    <p>
        The basic syntax of a function in C:
    </p>
    <pre>
return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // function body
}
    </pre>

    <h2>Types of Functions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Library Functions:</strong> These are built-in functions provided by C, such as <code>printf()</code>, <code>scanf()</code>, <code>strlen()</code>, etc., and are defined in header files like <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. User-defined Functions:</strong> These are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. Example:
    </p>
    <pre>
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
    </pre>

    <h2>Components of a Function</h2>

    <h3>Function Prototype</h3>
    <p>
        It declares the function to the compiler before its actual definition. It tells the return type, function name, and parameters.
    </p>
    <pre>
int add(int, int);
    </pre>

    <h3>Function Call</h3>
    <p>
        A function call invokes the function to perform its task. Example:
    </p>
    <pre>
int result = add(5, 3);
    </pre>

    <h3>Function Definition</h3>
    <p>
        The actual implementation of the function where the logic is written.
    </p>
    <pre>
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
    </pre>

    <h3>Return Type</h3>
    <p>
        The data type of value the function returns. If a function doesn’t return anything, it uses <code>void</code> as return type.
    </p>
    <pre>
int add(int a, int b);     // returns an int
void printMessage();       // returns nothing
    </pre>

    <h2>Function with Return Type and No Arguments</h2>
    <p>This type of function returns a value but does not take any parameters.</p>
    <pre><code>int getNumber() {
    return 42;
}

int main() {
    int num = getNumber();
    printf("Number is %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Function with Return Type and Arguments</h2>
    <p>This type of function takes arguments and returns a value.</p>
    <pre><code>int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(10, 15);
    printf("Sum is %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Function with No Return Type and No Arguments</h2>
    <p>This type of function neither returns a value nor takes arguments.</p>
    <pre><code>void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main() {
    greet();
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Function with No Return Type and Arguments</h2>
    <p>This type of function takes arguments but does not return a value.</p>
    <pre><code>void printSum(int a, int b) {
    printf("Sum is %d\n", a + b);
}

int main() {
    printSum(5, 7);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<h1>C Programming Storage Classes</h1>

    <h2>Automatic Storage Class</h2>
    <p>Variables declared inside a function are automatic by default. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.</p>

    <h2>External Storage Class</h2>
    <p>Used to declare global variables that can be accessed across multiple files.</p>

    <h2>Register Storage Class</h2>
    <p>Suggests to the compiler to store the variable in a CPU register for faster access (note: compiler may ignore).</p>

    <h2>Static Storage Class</h2>
    <p>Preserves the value of a variable between function calls and restricts variable scope to the file if declared globally.</p>

    <h2>Recursive Function</h2>
    <p>A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem. It must have a base case to stop recursion and prevent infinite loops.</p>

    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code>return_type functionName(parameters) {
    if (base_condition) {
        logic
        return value;
    } else {
        return functionName(modified_parameters);
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        #include stdio.h
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)  
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1);  
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", num, factorial(num));
    return 0;
}
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Passing Array to a Function</h2>
    <p>In C, arrays are passed to functions by passing the pointer to the first element of the array. You can also pass the size of the array as a separate argument.</p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        #include stdio.h

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int numbers[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int length = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);

    printf("Array elements: ");
    printArray(numbers, length);

    return 0;
}
    </code></pre>
